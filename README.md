# Terraform Examples

This folder contains a set of Terraform configs.

To run any example, just run `terraform apply` within that directory
if you have Terraform checked out. Or, you can run it directly from git:

  ```
  $ terraform init github.com/hashicorp/terraform/examples/aws-two-tier
  ...

  $ terraform apply
  ...
  ```
